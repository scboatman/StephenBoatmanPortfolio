       <p alighn="center">My Name is Stephen C. Boatman </p>
       <h2>My Background</h2>
        <p>I first fell in love with electronics when I was in the Air Force.  Being able to figure out how things work and bringing them back to life was thrilling!<br>
        During my time serving our country I was given the opportunity to lead maintenance teams aboard a communications platform.  This required learning to diagnose and maintain computer based systems.  From there on I always had computers in my life, be it through my own business ventures training business leaders on the latest mobile technologies and how they can utilize them to improve their businesses.<br>
        But, it was my stint at a large technology distributor that introduced me to Software Development.  I was facinated and knew I had to acquire that skill to round out my IT background.  I found myself acting like a kid on Christmas morning when ever I created code that actually functioned!<br>
        Now I'm ready to bring that excitement into my daily work life.</p>

       <h2>Why I Decided to Learn Programming</h2>
        <p>Having the opportunity to lead team as a Business Analyst brought me in close proximity to developers.  I had no clue what they were talking about, at first and once I came to know what they were tasked to do, I wanted to learn all I could about this <em>"Coding Thing"</em><br>
        I set out to learn on my own.  I made some progress, but you don't know until someone schools you on what you don't know.  That was over a year ago and now that I have acquired Web Development skills I see my future lined with more languages and frameworks to learn.  My furture education in software development looks bright!</p>
